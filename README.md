# Ananicy

## Description
Ananicy (ANother Auto NICe daemon) â€” is a shell daemon created to manage processes' [IO](http://linux.die.net/man/1/ionice) and [CPU](http://linux.die.net/man/1/nice) priorities, with community-driven set of rules for popular applications (anyone may add his own rule via github's [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) mechanism).

I think it's only for desktop usage.

I just wanted a tool for auto set programs nice in my system, i.e.:
* Why do I have a lags, while compiling kernel and playing a game?
* Why does dropbox client eat all my IO?
* Why does torrent/dc client make my laptop run slower?
* ...

Use ananicy to fix this problems!

Inside .rules file every process is described on a separate line, general syntax is described below:

```

```

All fields except NAME are optional.

NAME used for pgrep -w, so you can test your rules manually.

```
